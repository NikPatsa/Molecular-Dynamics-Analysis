This a python module to analyze molecular trajectories.
It can read both gromacs and lammps trajectories and topologies.
It has many futures for analyzing dynamics and structure especially for confined systems
Properties in non confined systems can also be computed.
Example templates of how to use where uploaded (find them in 'testing_v1.0'), along with some trajectory files
A jupyter notebook to guide you will also be uploaded
Soon explanations more documentation and explanations for users and potential developers will be uploaded
